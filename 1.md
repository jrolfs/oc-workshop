# Create an OC for your business card

* Create a new component named `bc-(username)` where username is the first letter of your name + your last name, example `bc-mfigus`.
* Publish the component to `http://oc-registry.herokuapp.com`.
* Edit the component: markup needs to contain some information, for example your name, your linked e-mail address, etc.
* Include an image and include it as static resources in the component  ([Help](https://github.com/opentable/oc/blob/master/docs/advanced-operations.md#add-static-resource-to-the-component)).
* Add some css inside a `<style>` tag and setup 2 skins: black (dark background and white text) and white (white background and dark text). Be creative with the CSS as you like.
* An optional parameter `skin` (`white`|`dark`, default `white`) should allow the to view the component with the appropriate css skin.
* The component should be re-published to `http://oc-registry.herokuapp.com` with a new version.
* Well done! [Part II](2.md)
