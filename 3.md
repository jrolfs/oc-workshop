# Consume an API on the server

* Create a new component for showing some stats about a github user. If you don't have an account on github, you can use mine: `matteofigus`. When making a call to github api (example `https://api.github.com/users/matteofigus/repos`), you should see some interesting stats. Your component may show the number of repos, the most starred repos, etc. Use some creativity.
  * On the server, use [`request`](https://github.com/request/request) module to make a call to the api. You will need to install the module, save it in the package.json, and restart your oc dev.
  * Your component will need to get a `username` parameter so that your component should be used for any user.
  * Publish the component
* Now nest the github component inside your business card component, passing your github username.
* If you made it until here this is great!
